# Cipher
This cipher technique considered more secure compared to other substitution algorithms reason being it breaks the message apart into two separate streams and then recombines them. It is a combination of the Polybius square with the transposition and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. This encrypting technique invented by Felin Delastelle. It just only ever used by amateur cryptographers.
