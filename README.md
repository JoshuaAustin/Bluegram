# Cipher in Java!
This cipher technique considered more secure compared to other substitution algorithms reason being it breaks the message apart into two separate streams and then recombines them. It is a combination of the Polybius square with the transposition and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. This encrypting technique invented by Felin Delastelle. It just only ever used by amateur cryptographers.
In this project I have made working code for both Bifid and Trifid Cipher!!!
